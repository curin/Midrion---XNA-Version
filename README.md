Midrion XNA  
  
This is an older version of the Midrion game that I am working on. This version was written and built in XNA. All that was completed in this version was a simple test of controls for the magic system that the game would use. This version is no longer being maintained but does include the building blocks for what will be in the final game.  
  
Controls:  
Q - Switch to magic mode  
Left Click - place Magic node or edge if you click to select a node then click another node  
Ctrl + Left Click - Quick Spell build (includes edge creation)  
Right Click - Delete Shape (buggy often crashes game if not clicked on a shape(which must be more than one connected node))  
  
This version is bug ridden and prone to crashes and only put up here as an illustration of work I have done and a project I am currently working on.
